r"""eval v1 distributed via minescript.net

Usage:
  \eval <pythonCode>

Executes <pythonCode> as either a Python expression (code
that can appear on the right-hand side of an assignment, in
which case the value is echoed to the chat screen) or Python
statements (e.g. a `for` loop).

Functions from minescript.py are available automatically without
qualification.

Multiple lines of code can be written using escaped newlines
(`\n`).

Examples:
  Print information about nearby entities to the chat screen:
  \eval "entities()"
  (note: entities() added in Minescript v2.1)

  Print the names of nearby entities to the chat screen:
  \eval "for e in entities(): echo(e['name'])"
  (note: entities() added in Minescript v2.1)

  Import `time` module, sleep 3 seconds, and take a screenshot:
  \eval "import time\ntime.sleep(3)\nscreenshot()"
  (note: screenshot() added in Minescript v2.1)

# `from ... import *` is normally considered poor form because of namespace
# pollution.  But it's desirable in this case because it allows single-line
# Python code that's entered in the Minecraft chat screen to omit the module
# prefix for brevity. And brevity is important for this use case.
